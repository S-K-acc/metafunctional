## Instructions

### Run Julia locally 

A recent version of [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) needs to be installed on your system.
Launch the Julia interpreter within this directory and type `]` to enter the package manager.
Activate the environment and install the required packages as follows:

```julia
activate .
instantiate
```

Type backspace to exit the package manager.
Start a Jupyter server:

```julia
using IJulia
jupyterlab()
```

This should open JupyterLab in your browser where you can navigate to `Prediction.ipynb` or to `Training.ipynb`.

### Contents

`Prediction.ipynb` is a script in which the prediction of a density profile with the help of the trained neural metadensity functional (`model.bson`) is performed. This also contains a comparison with simulation data. 
The training procedure of such a neural network is shown in `Training.ipynb`; see the instructions therein for access to a pregenerated training data set. `GenerateVext.jl` contains functions for generating a random external potential that leads to an inhomogeneous density profile. The file `neural.jl` provides functions needed for the usage of the neural metadensity functional as well as for the DFT-minimization (Picard iteration) and for the preparation of training data. `simulation.jl` allows one to carry out Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations which can be used for the generation of training data and for the verification of the accuracy of predictions made with the neural method. 

This code is build upon the [NeuralDFT-Tutorial](https://github.com/sfalmo/NeuralDFT-Tutorial). There, the underlying methods, e.g. 1D-GCMC and the local learning strategy are explained in more detail.
